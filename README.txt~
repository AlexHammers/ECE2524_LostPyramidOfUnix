Pyramid of Unix is a fun and easy game that helps students study
for their Unix class. It is a race to the top of the pyramid as
players answer Unix-based questions. Get one correct, move one level
closer to the title of Supreme Unix Master. First to five wins!

Directions:

1. Download the folder from github to your Desktop (or new directory)
   Eight (8) files total.

2. Open Terminal

3. Change the dimension of your terminal window to 
   80x43. You can do this by selecting Terminal-> 80x43.
   If 80x43 is not an available option, chose one similar.

4. Next, navigate to your Desktop (or new directory)

5. Within the downloaded directory, enter "make" and press enter in the terminal.
   There should be two lines printed out.  

6. Next, enter the following command to run the program (no quotes):

7. That's it! You're on your way to having hours of Unix fun. 
   Note: Players should flip a coin to determine who goes first.
